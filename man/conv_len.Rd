\title{Convert lengths}
\usage{
conv_len(lengths)
}
\arguments{
\item{\strong{lengths}}{character vector of lengths}
}
\description{
Convert lengths from character vector, containing values like "3/4" and "hd"
into a numeric vector.
}
\details{
This function makes some assumptions, so may need tweaking over time.
For each string in a vector it is first split up by the spaces in it, so "1 3/4"
is split into "1" "3/4", if there are no spaces then it assesses the single
number/letters against a list of common length margins.  If the split vector
has length 2 then it assumes the first element is a whole number, and the
second is a fraction (like "3/4"), it calculates the total margin.  There is no
doubt for edge cases that this function doesn't cover which will cause errors,
the function was harder to write than initially thought, and will likely need
improvements as edge cases are encountered
