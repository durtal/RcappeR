#' Handicap a race using one race
#'
#' Assess the performance of a winner (ie handicap) of a race using race
#' standardisation; which uses the performances of runners in a different, but
#' similar, race for this assessment.  It is called by \link{zipf_hcp} and
#' \link{zipf_init}.
#'
#' @details The method of race standardisation used was first explained by Simon
#' Rowlands and uses Zipfs Law.  The difference at the weights, from the race
#' to be handicapped, is applied to the second race, creating a vector of
#' possible ratings the victor could have achieved.  This is where Zipfs Law
#' plays its part, as depending on the finishing position, different weights
#' are assigned to each of the ratings in the vector, placing more significance
#' on horses towards the front of the field.
