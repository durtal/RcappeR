title: "mean_rating"
---
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(RcappeR)
```

Helper function to be used as the statistic parameter to the `boot` function from the boot package.  The `boot` function generates replicates of a statistic using bootstrap resampling.  This function can be used when wishing to bootstrap the mean of possible ratings returned by [zipf_hcp](zipf_hcp.html).

### Usage
```{r eval=FALSE}
mean_rating(data, index)
```

### Arguments

param | details
------|-------
data | dataframe
index | row indexes

### Example

Imagine `zipf_hcp` has been used to handicap a race, but the sample of races used is only small, this is a good time to use those races with the `mean_rating` and `boot` functions to resample them and generate a more robust mean

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(boot)

hcp_out # this is the list returned by 'zipf_hcp'
boot(data = hcp_out$ratings, statistic = mean_rating, R = 1000)
```
