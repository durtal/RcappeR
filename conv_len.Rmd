title: "conv_len"
---
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(RcappeR)
```

Converts character vector of lengths, such as "3/4", "nse", "hd", and "1 1/2", into numeric vector.

### Usage
```{r eval=FALSE}
conv_len(lengths)
```

### Arguments

param | details
------|-------
lengths | character vector of lengths

### Details

This function makes some assumptions, so may need tweaking over time. For each string in a vector it is first split up by the spaces in it, so "1 3/4" is split into "1" "3/4", if there are no spaces then it assesses the single number/letters against a list of common length margins. If the split vector has length 2 then it assumes the first element is a whole number, and the second is a fraction (like "3/4"), it calculates the total.

### Example Use

```{r}
lengths <- c("0", "nse", "hd", "1/2", "3/4", "1 1/2", "3 3/4")

conv_len(lengths = lengths)
```
