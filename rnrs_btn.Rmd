title: "rnrs_btn"
---
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(RcappeR)
```

Calculates percentage of runners beaten

### Usage
```{r eval=FALSE}
rnrs_btn(pos)
```

### Arguments

param | details
------|-------
pos | finishing positions

### Details

This is best used with the power of the **dplyr** package, to calculate the percentage of runners beaten across numerous races in the same dataframe.

### Example Use

The [gulfstream](gulfstream.html) dataset included in the package can show the usage of this function best.  That dataset contains races over 6 and 8 furlongs, on dirt and turf.  We'll assess the percentage of runners beaten according to starting gate (post position, draw, etc), for races over the 6 furlong dirt course.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

data(gulfstream)

gulfstream %>%
    filter(dist == 6, surf == "dirt") %>%
    group_by(date, race) %>%
    mutate(pct_btn = rnrs_btn(pos)) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    group_by(gate) %>%
    summarise(pct_btn = mean(pct_btn))
```
