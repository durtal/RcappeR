Description: A collection of tools to aid the analysis and handicapping of
    Thoroughbred Horse Racing.  A number of tools help do grunt work, helping
    to clean and prepare data for the more complicated tools.  These cleaning
    tools include converting margins from lengths into seconds, converting
    character string times into numeric times, etc.  The more complicated tools
    help with handicapping the races, by using race standardisation.
